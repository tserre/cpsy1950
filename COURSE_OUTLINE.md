# CPSY 1950 — Course Outline (Spring 2026)

## Core Format

- **T/Th, 80 minutes each**
- **Tuesday:** Lecture introducing the week's theme (conceptual, figure-first)
- **Thursday:** Lightning mini-conference on the same theme
  - ~15 lightning talks (2:00 talk + 0:30 transition)
  - ~20–30 min synthesis discussion/activity

## Group & Presentation Plan

- Lightning talks are prepared in small groups (typically 3, occasionally 4)
- Groups are not fixed: students form new groups for each lightning week (rotating teams)
- Posters are reserved for student projects (after spring break)
- **Equity:** Presentation turns tracked at individual student level so each student presents the same number of times (lightning talks + project poster)

## Week 1 — Course Kickoff
**Thu 1/22** — Kickoff
