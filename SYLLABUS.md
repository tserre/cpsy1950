## Course Description

This seminar-style course explores cutting-edge research at the intersection of natural and artificial intelligence. Students will engage with recent papers and develop critical perspectives on how biological and artificial systems process information. Topics include visual processing, learning mechanisms, neural representations, cognitive architectures, and the principles of intelligence shared between brains and machines.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Critically evaluate research papers in NeuroAI
2. Understand computational principles shared between biological and artificial intelligence
3. Present complex technical material clearly and effectively
4. Engage in scientific discussion and constructive critique
5. Identify open questions and future research directions in the field

## Course Format

This course uses an innovative **lecture + lightning mini-conference** format:

### Tuesday (80 minutes)
- **Lecture**: Instructor introduces the week's theme
- Figure-first, conceptual approach
- Sets up debates and key questions

### Thursday (80 minutes)
- **Lightning Mini-Conference**: Student presentations
- ~15 lightning talks (2:00 presentation + 0:30 transition)
- ~20-30 minutes synthesis discussion/activity
- Rotating small groups (3-4 students)

### Special Formats
- **Week 2**: Asynchronous bootcamp (conditional videos/readings)
- **Weeks 11-12**: Project studio + poster mini-conferences
- **Weeks 13-14**: Guest lectures

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Background in either:
  - Neuroscience/cognitive science, OR
  - Machine learning/AI
- Linear algebra (or willingness to complete bootcamp)
- Calculus
- Or permission of instructor

**Note**: Week 2 bootcamp provides conditional catch-up materials for students with gaps in deep learning, linear algebra, or neuroscience fundamentals.

### Grading

- **Lightning Talks (40%)**: Small group presentations (Weeks 3-9)
- **Project Poster (30%)**: Research project poster presentation
- **Final Exam (20%)**: Cumulative exam (May 12, 9:00am)
- **Participation (10%)**: Active engagement in discussions and synthesis activities

### Lightning Talks (Weeks 3-9)

**Format:**
- Small groups (typically 3, occasionally 4 students)
- Groups rotate each week (different teammates throughout semester)
- 2-minute presentation per group
- Each student presents equal number of times (tracked individually)

**Preparation:**
- Groups select from curated paper pool for each theme
- Focus on key contribution and critical evaluation
- Practice timing (strict 2-minute limit)

### Project Poster (Weeks 11-12)

**Focus**: Cognitive alignment and behavioral evaluation
- Individual or small group projects
- Explores "what's missing" themes from Week 9
- Two in-class poster sessions (17 posters each)
- Studio time provided in Week 11 for development

**Deliverables:**
1. Project poster (standard academic poster format)
2. Brief synthesis document (2-3 pages)

## Course Policies

### Attendance
Attendance is essential for mini-conferences (lightning talks) and group work. Each student's presentation schedule depends on the class roster.

**Excused absences**: Notify instructor in advance when possible. Alternative arrangements will be made for lightning talk groups affected by absences.

### Group Work
- Groups rotate each lightning week
- All group members receive the same grade for each presentation
- Individual contribution tracked across semester
- Project posters may be individual or small group

### Academic Integrity
All work must be your own (or your group's for collaborative work). 
- Properly cite sources in presentations
- Do not plagiarize from papers or other presentations
- Generative AI: Permitted for brainstorming and draft feedback, but final work must be your own synthesis

### Accommodation
Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all students. If you have a disability or condition requiring accommodations, please contact Student and Employee Accessibility Services (SEAS).

### Late Work
- Lightning talks cannot be rescheduled (live presentation format)
- Project posters: Late submissions accepted with prior arrangement only
- Final exam: No makeup exam without documented emergency

## Topics

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-2)
- Week 1: Course kickoff
- Week 2: Bootcamp (async - conditional requirements)

- Week 4: Scaling laws and emergence

### Phase 3: Explainable AI (Weeks 5-6)

- Week 6: XAI-B (mechanistic interpretability)

### Phase 4: AI ↔ Neuroscience Bridge (Weeks 7-8)
- Week 7: AI → Neuroscience (alignment, neural prediction)
- Week 8: Neuroscience → AI (bio-inspired architectures)

### Phase 5: Cognitive Alignment (Week 9)
- Week 9: What's missing + cognitive alignment intro
