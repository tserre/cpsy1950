## Course Description

This seminar-style course explores cutting-edge research at the intersection of natural and artificial intelligence. Students will engage with recent papers and develop critical perspectives on how biological and artificial systems process information. Topics include visual processing, learning mechanisms, neural representations, cognitive architectures, and the principles of intelligence shared between brains and machines.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Critically evaluate research papers in NeuroAI
2. Understand computational principles shared between biological and artificial intelligence
3. Present complex technical material clearly and effectively
4. Engage in scientific discussion and constructive critique
5. Identify open questions and future research directions in the field

## Course Format

This is a seminar-style course. Each session will involve:
- Student presentations of recent research papers
- Guided discussion and critical analysis
- Connections to broader themes in intelligence research

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Background in either neuroscience/cognitive science OR machine learning/AI
- Programming experience (Python preferred)
- Linear algebra and calculus
- Or permission of instructor

### Grading

- **Participation & Discussion (30%)**: Active engagement in class discussions
- **Paper Presentations (40%)**: Present 2-3 papers throughout the semester
- **Final Project (30%)**: Research proposal or literature review

### Presentations

Each student will present 2-3 papers throughout the semester. Presentations should:
- Summarize the main contributions (15 min)
- Provide critical analysis (5 min)
- Lead discussion (10 min)

### Final Project

Options:
1. **Research Proposal**: Propose a novel research project combining insights from neuroscience and AI
2. **Literature Review**: Comprehensive review of a specific topic in NeuroAI
3. **Replication Study**: Reproduce and extend results from a published paper
